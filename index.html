            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3. Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as
                improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion
                rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability,
                promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by
                various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy
                2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the
                Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by
                various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations,
                academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Demand for private schools has been growing over the years. While a
                consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet
                emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a
                dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools, greater affordability of private schools, and
                non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools. After the adoption of the Right to
                Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be 'government-recognised'. A private school
                would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions. At the primary and
                secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with
                29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.Certain post-secondary technical
                schools are also private.</p>
